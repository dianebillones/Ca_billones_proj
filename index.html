      <h3>Greetings!</h3>
       <p>
        
       I am Diane Angeli T. Billones, the creator of this web site. I am currently 15 years and 6 months old. My name “Diane” was taken from the name of the late Princess Dianna. It was my sister who named me this. She told me that I was named after the late Princess because during the week of my birth, my sister was doing a book report on a book talking about the very inspirational life of the late Princess Diana, which inspired her to name me after her. “Angeli” was a name derived from the word “Angel”. My father named me this because it was a tradition in our family to have at least a religious name in our names. Our family consists of 5 members, my father, my mother, my eldest brother, my middle sister, and me, the youngest. A very interesting trivia about me is that my brother is only 16 years older than me, and my sister is also just 9 years older than me. Isn’t it cool?

        <br> <br>

        My social issue in this web site is online learning and its different aspects affecting lives. Online learning is something the majority of the students are experiencing in these years of pandemic. It has advantages and disadvantages, and I’m sure that people always complain about the disadvantages, especially of its effectiveness and how it has affected our lives. I, myself, has complained about this torture-like education. This social issue rose as soon as online learning was implemented due to the worries of students and has become a bigger issue as people have experienced the online set-up for much longer. Hence, I created this website to share my opinions of this social issue and to give the viewers also a space to share their own opinions about it. OLPinions is a website where your opinions about online learning and its different aspects affecting lives is welcome and hopefully respected by everyone.

        <br> <br>

        I have many hopes for the future. I hope that I will be able to graduate high school and college successfully and be able to have a stable job so that I can feed myself and my family in the far future. I hope I’ll be able to live my life to the fullest even though it is filled with dozens and millions of rocks and creating the bumpiest ride I’ve ever taken. I hope that people will start to see the beauty of online learning, and continue to adjust to it. This set-up may be temporary, but it is still the type of learning we are having and education is something every one of us should appreciate. I hope that my social issue will begin to fade in the near future, and I also hope that online learning will continue to improve so that it won’t affect our lives as much as when it was implemented. There may be a lot of things we hope to be fulfilled, but it is important not to lose hope so that one day we may be able to see them in reality.

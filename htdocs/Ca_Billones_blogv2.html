            <!-- First Paraagraph -->

            <p>
                &nbsp &nbsp In the beginning, we have always wondered, "Will online learning be effective?" Today, most of the students are experiencing online learning, including myself. Online learning is when you attend classes and take courses online instead of in a physical classroom (What Is Online Learning? n.d.). On the other hand, traditional learning is when we attend our classes and courses in physical classroom or face-to-face classes. Each of us has our own opinion about online learning. However, it is essential to our education today; I believe it is not as effective as traditional learning due to its disadvantages.

            <p>
                &nbsp &nbsp Disadvantages of online learning have made it much more difficult, as reflected in the opinions of the 89% of the families.  First, you need to have good and stable internet to effectively use the given resources and learn things, which not all people have. This challenge hinders people who do not have a stable and good internet connection from learning with ease and completing homework (Lynch, 2021). Second, online learning results in social isolation. Social isolation in online learning happens due to the lack of human interaction and can cause mental health issues, stress, and anxiety affecting the student's performance (High Focus Centers, 2020). Lastly, Online learning requires self-motivation and time management skills. In face-to-face classes, both teachers and activities with classmates help prevent a student from falling off track and falling behind. However, following a routine can be challenging for students who lack self-motivation or time management skills in online learning (ambiguous@lms, 2020). I, myself, experienced these difficulties, which affected my physical health and my mental health.
            </p>

            <p>
                &nbsp &nbsp For some, online learning is effective, but for others, online learning is just not as effective as traditional learning. There are many reasons why people think it is much more difficult and less effective. I believe it is because of its disadvantages, such as online learning requiring things not everyone has, and results in social isolation. Another disadvantage is that it requires self-motivation and time management skills. Due to these disadvantages, I believe that online learning is not as effective as traditional learning.
